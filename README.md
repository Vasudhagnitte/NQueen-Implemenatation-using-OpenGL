# NQueen-Implemenatation-using-OpenGL

Implementation of NQueen with User Interaction using OpenGL Library

This program implementation helps in visualising NQueen algorithm.

Steps to run this Project:-

1)Install GLUT library in your codeblocks software.The video link to install the library is given below.
https://youtu.be/VMsTI_CC-jc.

2)After the installation,open the glut project and copy paste the code.

3)At runtime u can declare the size of the queen, its better to declare the size of queen as 4 or 5.

3)First page contains the details of our project, after pressing the enter key, u can view the chessboard.

4)Use the mouse left button to create a green sphere,depicting the queen.

5)Use mouse right button to remove the queen.

6)Incase u cannot place the queen(Diagonal,vertical or horizontal)it will play a default system music,indicating that a queen cannot be placed.
